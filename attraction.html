  <p class="gr"><b class="caption">The golden rock</b>
Golden Rock, also locally referred to as Kyaiktiyo Zedi is a truly awesome sight. It is a pagoda (zedi) that sits atop a huge rock that appears as if it’s about to fall from the edge of the cliff. The pagoda and rock, both are covered with golf leaf. The locals believe that the rock that is situated 1,100 meters above sea level is held at this place through a miracle of Buddha. Moreover, the pagoda is said to have a strand of Buddha’s hair. It is a pilgrimage for Myanmar Buddhists. Golden Rock is located around a five-hour drive from Yangon and also, includes a long walk. A staircase leads to the pagoda complex that houses various viewing platforms and Buddha shrines.

  <p class="shwe"><b class="caption">Shwenandaw Monastery</b> is an ancient Buddhist monastery located in the city of Mandalay. Majorly known as the Golden Palace, this edifice is situated in central Myanmar. Originally, it was the part of the Mandalay Palace complex. At once, the entire building was covered with gold but the gold is inside now. The exterior of this monastery is covered with ornate teak carvings representing Buddhist myths.

  <p class="dmt"><b class="caption">Dhammayangyi Temple</b> is a Buddhist temple located in Bagan, Myanmar. Largest of all the temples in Bagan, the Dhammayan as it is popularly known was built during the reign of King Narathu. Narathu, who came to the throne by assassinating his father Alaungsithu and his elder brother, presumably built this largest temple to atone for his sins. The Dhammayangyi is the widest temple in Bagan, and is built in a plan similar to that of Ananda Temple. Burmese chronicles state.</p>
	<img class="sadan" src="img/sadan.jpg" width="400px">
  <p class="sdc"><b class="caption">Sadan Cave</b> is located near Hpa An and is one of the largest caves I’ve discovered in Myanmar, dominated by dozens of incredible Buddha statues, intrinsic wall carvings, and with bats hanging from the ceiling.Definitely bring a headlamp to guide your way through the pitch-black giant cave chambers, so you can see marvellous stalagmites, stalactites, and sparkling crystal walls.Not that I’d recommend it, but I adventured through the cave barefoot, climbing slippery rocks, and ushering my way through the narrow passageways.</p>

		<p class="manaw"><b>Manaw Festival</b> is usually held in Kachin State and is held every year in January to welcome the New Year.

	   <img class="paung" src="img/paung.jpg" width="550px">
	    <p class="tgf">The most popular festival held in the Shan State is the <b>Taunggyi Tazaungdaing</b>, also known as the Festival of Lights, which usually happens around November. During the festival, you can see many hot air balloons of varying shapes and sizes that are launched to the sky as an offering to the heavens, and to fight off evil spirits. The festival is quite popular among the locals because it’s similar to music festivals where there are loud music and lots of beer and food. If you are travelling to Myanmar in November, make sure to witness this awesome event. Booking your hotel in advance is highly recommended, as the city runs out of accommodations very quickly due to the high number of travellers.   </p>

	  <p class="tg">The most famous festival in Myanmar, the <b>Thingyan Water Festival</b> is held in celebration of the Myanmar New Year. This festival is similar to the famous Songkran Festival in Thailand wherein people throw or splash water at one another during the four-day festival. The festival happens all across the Yangon region, but Mandalay has the bragging rights for being the most crowded city to celebrate the Myanmar New Year. Usually, the festival lasts four days but on a leap year, it lasts five days. On the Burmese New Year day, Myanmar people also do good deeds by offering meals and snacks, taking Sabbath, or cutting nails for their elders.</p>

	  <p class="pdo">If your travel plans in Myanmar include hitting Inle Lake in October, you’re in for a treat as this is the time and place of the <b>Phaung Daw Oo Pagoda Festival</b>. Spanning across three weeks, this festival is dedicated to Buddha. Four of his images are removed from the pagoda and rowed around Inle Lake on a barge moved by foot rowers (yes, they row the boat with their foot!). The boat travels to 14 villages so everyone can have a chance to see the Buddhas and pay their respects.At each stop, the villages meet the boat with crazy excitement to welcome the barge which will stay overnight. Another standout part of the festival are the rowing.</p>

	<h1 class="head">Burmese Traditional Art And Dance</h1>
	
	
	<p class="dance">Burmese Dance comprises folk and classical elements corresponding to the varied forms of Burmese music. Burma's dance styles were originally influenced by neighboring cultures (Thai, Chinese and Indonesian) and its theater forms by the staging of Buddhist stories and propitiation ceremonies of spirit cults. Both genres developed distinctive forms in response to the country's rich cultural and religious mix and to changing political circumstances. The dance and music together create an ornamented, shimmering and exciting effect for the audience. </p>
